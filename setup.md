# Before setting things up

To help develop this style guide you will need to have installed:

* Git 👇
* [Brew](http://brew.sh/) 🍺
* Node - Npm (`$ brew install node`) 📗

>To check if they're installed in your computer, you may try by doing `which` + the program name (`$ which git`, for example).

## Starting

First off, choose where you'll download and keep your own copy of the guide. It might be in `~/devel/`.

Start by cloning the repository locating yourself in that directory and do `$ git clone git@github.com:comparaonline/design-style-guide.git`.

Enter that folder and run it with `$ npm start`.

The rest can be found in [Fabricator's Readme](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator#readme).

## After these steps...

The next time you'll modify the project, to run it locally it's enough to execute it by `$ gulp --dev`.
